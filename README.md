# Machine-learning-works
ðŸš€ A collection of complete machine learning  with code, datasets, and trained models.
# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of full machine learning and deep learning projects.  
Each project is structured to demonstrate the complete workflow â€” from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation, visualization, and deployment.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- End-to-end ML projects: data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ”¹ Project Structure
- Each project has its own folder with:
  - Dataset (or dataset link if too large)
  - Python notebooks / scripts
  - README describing the project

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose
- To showcase end-to-end ML workflows
- To provide reusable code and pre-trained models
- To track and improve ML projects over time

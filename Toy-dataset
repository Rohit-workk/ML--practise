# Toy Datasets Projects Repository
ðŸ§¸ A collection of machine learning projects using inbuilt datasets from scikit-learn for learning, experimentation, and practice.  

This repository contains small-scale projects that use well-known datasets included in libraries like **scikit-learn** and other toy datasets. The aim is to practice and demonstrate key machine learning concepts, algorithms, and workflows in a concise and reproducible manner.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- End-to-end machine learning workflows on small datasets  
- Classification, regression, and clustering projects  
- Use of inbuilt datasets like:
  - Iris  
  - Boston Housing  
  - Diabetes  
  - Digits  
  - Wine  
  - Breast Cancer  
- Preprocessing techniques: scaling, normalization, encoding, handling missing values  
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, regression metrics  
- Visualizations to understand dataset distribution and model performance  

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  


## ðŸ”¹ Purpose
- Practice and demonstrate machine learning concepts on small datasets  
- Provide reproducible code for educational and experimental purposes  
- Serve as a reference for quick implementations of common ML tasks

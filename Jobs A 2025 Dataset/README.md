## 🔍 Project Description  
This notebook demonstrates data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques on the Jobs A 2025 dataset, which comprises job listings with various categorical and numerical attributes.  
The primary goal is to clean, explore, and transform the dataset to prepare it for downstream tasks like analysis or machine learning modeling.

## 🧩 Data Loading  
- The dataset contains 4000 rows and 20 features such as job title, company, location, salary ranges, contract type, and creation dates.  
- Data types include both categorical (`object`) and numerical (`int64`, `float64`) columns.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps  

### 1. Basic Exploration  
- Checking dataset shape, column names, and data types.  
- Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features using `.describe()` and `.info()`.  

### 2. Missing Values Analysis  
- Identified missing values in key columns like `company_name` (5.35%), `latitude` (18.57%), `contract_type` (~78%), and salary fields (>60%).  
- This step prepares the ground for handling missing data either by imputation or removal.

### 3. Unique Value Counts  
- Counting distinct values in each column to understand categorical diversity and detect potential noisy or sparse features.

## 🧬 Feature Engineering Practice  

### Sample Approaches You Could Apply:
- **Handling Missing Data:** Fill or drop missing values based on data importance and completeness.  
- **Date Processing:** Convert `created_dt` and `created_date` to datetime objects to extract additional features like day of week, month, or recency.  
- **Categorical Encoding:** Convert textual categories (e.g., `contract_type`, `category_label`) into numeric form using one-hot encoding or label encoding.  
- **Feature Creation:** Derive new columns such as salary range spread (`salary_max - salary_min`) or salary buckets for salary columns.  
- **Geospatial Features:** Use latitude and longitude to add regional or country-level aggregations or enrich with population/demographics data.

## 💡 Summary  
This project provides a foundation for typical data preprocessing and feature engineering workflows on job listing data.  
Its insights and transformations help prepare the dataset for modeling or deeper analysis by transforming raw, incomplete, heterogeneous data into a clean, structured format optimized for machine learning pipelines.

## 📌 Note  
To apply these techniques, you can use the pandas and numpy libraries in Python, along with visualization and ML libraries for downstream analysis.

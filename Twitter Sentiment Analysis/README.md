🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project 🐦
📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes sentiments from a large collection of tweets to classify them into four sentiment categories. Using a combination of traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, it provides insights into public opinion expressed on Twitter.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 74,681 tweets labeled with four sentiment classes.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Cleaned tweets by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stop words.

Handled emojis by converting them into text descriptions 😊 ➡️ :smiling_face:

Expanded common English slang and short forms (e.g., "lol" → "laughing out loud").

For deep learning models, tokenized text and padded sequences to fixed length.

For classical ML models, applied TF-IDF vectorization.

🤖 Modeling Approaches
Logistic Regression + TF-IDF: Fast and effective baseline model for sentiment classification.

RNN with LSTM: Uses word embeddings to capture the sequence and context in tweets.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 🐍, Pandas, NumPy

NLTK for text preprocessing

TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models

scikit-learn for TF-IDF and classical machine learning

Emoji library for emoji handling

🚀 How to Run
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in your working directory.

Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.

Train the models:

Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectors

RNN with embedding and LSTM layers

Use the prediction script to test new tweets and predict sentiment.

📈 Results
Achieved strong accuracy for multi-class sentiment classification on Twitter data.

Demonstrates how combining preprocessing and modeling techniques boosts performance.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Integrate pretrained embeddings (GloVe, FastText) for better semantic understanding.

Experiment with transformer-based models like BERT for more accurate context capture.

Add modules for sarcasm and irony detection to refine sentiment analysis.

Feel free to explore and customize this project! 😊
